# Organizational Hierarchy Project
Constraints:

<b>Problem Statement: </b> <br/>
Design a tree-based data structure to manage an organizational hierarchy, where employees are assigned unique IDs and levels. Implement operations to hire employees, assign bosses, fire employees, and <b>find common bosses.</b>

<b>Objective: </b> <br/>
Develop an efficient solution that allows for easy management and manipulation of the organizational hierarchy, enabling quick access to employee levels, determining bosses, and visualizing the hierarchy. Optimize the implementation to achieve <b>O(log(n)) time complexity </b>for most operations.

<b>Constraints: </b> <br/>
The hierarchy has multiple levels, with level 1 being the highest.<br/>
An employee works under another employee at the previous level.<br/>
Employees can be hired, fired, and managed by other employees.

<b>Major Complexity in the Problem: </b> <br/>
Efficiently maintaining the hierarchical structure of the organization. <br/>
Implementing operations like hiring, firing, and finding common bosses in an optimized manner. <br/>
Ensuring proper level assignments and handling exceptions for illegal operations. <br/>
